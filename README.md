# structured-text-demo

This demo shows how to render an entry that uses the Contentful Structured Text field with linked entries.

## Usage:

First install the dependencies

```sh
$ npm install
```

Add your `spaceId`, `accessToken` and `entryId` to the variables in the [demo](../master/index.js).

Then build the page by running

```sh
$ npm start
```

This will open the rendered entry in your default browser.
