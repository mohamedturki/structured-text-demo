# structured-text-demo

This demo shows how to render an entry that uses the Contentful Structured Text field with linked entries.

## Usage:

First install the dependencies

```sh
$ npm install
```

Copy the `env.example` content into a new file `.env` and fill out the variables.

Then build the page by running

```sh
$ npm start
```

This will open the rendered entry in your default browser.
